# Snippets of Wisdom

 Stack Overflow is great for getting your development questions answered, but… what if you don’t have a question? what if you just want to learn stuff that you don’t know you need? or you don’t suspect you are doing wrong? I’ve found Medium to be an excellent place to do just that. I did my research before taking my leap from WebForms (ugh) to React by reading a lot of articles, most of them posted here. I read about abstract or architectural stuff, tendencies, new libraries, pros and cons of my language of choice, just about anything that helps me stay updated. I even (especially?) read those funny research articles David Gilbertson writes.

 As a sloppy attempt to give back, I posted an article with a 10,000 ft overview of Angular 2 for newbies. I won’t link to it because I don’t recommend it. Now I am starting a second sloppy attempt to give back, with what I’ve called “Snippets of Wisdom”. It’s a big name that I will probably will not live up to, but a guy can dream. the idea is that whenever I learn something useful I’ll post it for others to learn /refresh / discard. This won’t be language specific, although will probably be mostly .net core and javascript as it is what I am using now.
